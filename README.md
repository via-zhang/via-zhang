ðŸŒ± Hi! I'm a Geography and Data Science student at the University of Florida, passionate about leveraging geospatial data to combat climate change and to gain a better understanding of our cultural and physical landscapes. I hope to apply geospatial research and data storytelling to help communities build resilience against climate change.

ðŸŽ¨ As an artist, I love to embrace creativity in everything I do, from visualizing data to making dashboards. I chose to study the intersection of data science and geography because of the opportunities to inspire sustainable solutions through collaboration, research, and storytelling.
